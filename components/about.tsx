        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">BS Information Technology</span>, I landed
        in different jobs to fulfill my passion in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">programming</span>.{" "}
        <span className="font-small">
          There's no better feeling than

            {" "}
            cracking a tough coding problem{" "}
          </span>{" "}
          â€“ that's what makes programming so fulfilling for me.
        </span>{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is <span className="font-medium">React, Java (Spring), and mySQL</span>.
        I am also familiar with TypeScript, Angular, and PHP. I am always
        looking to learn new technologies.

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not working</span>, I enjoy playing
        computer games, watching vlog, playing organ, and travel (either commute or motorcycle).  I am currently
        learning about{" "}

        also learning how to play the piano.
